# follows_me_back
quick little project seeing who doesn't follow me back on instagram after web scraping followers and following in a csv file


# how to use
1. clone the repo
2. install python3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/) then 'pip install csv' (if you don't have it)
3. use a web scraping tool like Data Scraper to get your followers and following in a csv file
      - make sure to scroll through all your follwers/following so the tool can get all of them
4. add the csv files to the repo named 'followers.csv' and 'following.csv'
5. in console run 'python main.py'
